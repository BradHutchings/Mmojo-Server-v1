The sixth step in building Mmojo Server is to package the `mmojo-server` Actual Portable Executable (APE) for deployment.

We have two options:
1. [6a. Package Mmojo Server (Standalone)](6a-Package-Mmojo-Server.md) - Package standalone server. A model file **is not** included in the `mmojo-server` APE file.
2. [6b. Package Mmojo Server One (Embedded Model)](6b-Package-Mmojo-Server-One.md) - Package server with embedded .gguf model file. The model file **is** included in the `mmojo-server-one` APE file.

This is like a *Choose Your Own Adventure* book. Pick your path by clicking one of the options above.
