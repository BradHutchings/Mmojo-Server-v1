The sixth step in building Mmojo Server is to package the Mmojo Server builds.

We have two options:
1. [6a. Package mmojo-server](6a-Package-mmojo-server.md)
   - Package server as an Actual Portable Executable (APE) file.
   - A model file **is not** included in the `mmojo-server` APE file.
   - Cross platform (Linux, Windows, macOS).
   - Cross architecture (x86_64, ARM64).
     
2. [6b. Package mmojo-server one](6b-Package-mmojo-server-one.md)
   - Package server as an Actual Portable Executable (APE) file.
   - A model file is included in the `mmojo-server-one` APE file.
   - Cross platform (Linux, Windows, macOS).
   - Cross architecture (x86_64, ARM64).

This is like a *Choose Your Own Adventure* book. Pick your path by clicking one of the options above.
