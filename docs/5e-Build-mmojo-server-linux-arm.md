The fifth step in building Mmojo Server is to build the `mmojo-server` executables.

In this substep, we will build `mmojo-server-linux-arm` for general Linux ARM64 builds. We don't have cross-compiling from x86 Linux worked out yet, so you should run this step on, for example, a Raspberry Pi 5. 

The resulting executable will run on any Linux ARM64 system. Support files can be packaged in an adjacent `mmojo-server-support` directory.
