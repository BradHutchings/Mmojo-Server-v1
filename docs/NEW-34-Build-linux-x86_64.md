### About this Step
In this step, we will build Mmojo Server (`mmojo-server-linux-x86`) for general Linux x86_64 builds. We don't have cross-compiling from x86 Linux worked out yet, so you should run this step on an x86_64 PC or in a suitable virtual machine. 

The resulting executable will run on any Linux x86_64 system. Support files can be packaged in an adjacent `mmojo-server-support` directory.
