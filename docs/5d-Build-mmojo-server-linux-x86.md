The fifth step in building Mmojo Server is to build the `mmojo-server` executables.

In this substep, we will build `mmojo-server-linux-x86` for general Linux x86_64 builds. We don't have cross-compiling from x86 Linux worked out yet, so you should run this step on an x86_64 PC or in a suitable virtual machine. 

The resulting executable will run on any Linux x86_64 system. Support files can be packaged in an adjacent `mmojo-server-support` directory.
