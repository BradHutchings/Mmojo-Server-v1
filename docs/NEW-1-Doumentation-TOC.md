[10. Prepare Build Environment](NEW-10-Prepare-Build-Environment.md)

Before you can build Mmojo Server, you need a build environment. Depending on what you want to build, it could be a single computer or multiple computers. You should have a separate share on your network to keep files you only need to download once, and keep the products of your builds. You may find yourself rebuilding your build environments regularly, especially if you edit or enhance code and instructions in the repo.
